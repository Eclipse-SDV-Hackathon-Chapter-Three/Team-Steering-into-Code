2. How Do You Work
<br>
-Development Process (planning/tracking)
<br>
We started by having a brainstorm so that we could find a solution for the problem that was presented to us. We created a notion file and a github to be able to share information regarding the project.
We decided to connect to the host machine so that we can first run some simulations and from that see what we can improve or make after reading documentaion and the pyton files
